                    <h2>Facial Recognition App</h2>
                    <p>The app I made as part of my final year project at university. The purpose of the app is to guess a user's emotion from thier facial expression and then direct them to a music playlist based on that emotion; Happy, for example! This was a great oppertunity to learn a language I has no experience in and experiment with APIs.</p>

                    <p>I tried to stick to a consistent (quite blocky) look for all of the objects inside the house. It features user interaction with objects, collectible items and collision detecion.  I also used this game to learn how to create my own models, work with menus, particle effects and multiple scenes.</p>
