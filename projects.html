                    <p>A pet project i've had for many years and attempted to complete in a least 3 other languages. This Year I finally solved a lot of the efficiency and logic issues which have ended by past attempts.</p>

                    <p>The source code for this project is available to browse through on my Github Repo. I've also got plans on future additions to this version as well as an online multiplayer version (in time).</p>

                    <p>The app I made as part of my final year project at university. The purpose of the app is to guess a user's emotion from thier facial expression and then direct them to a music playlist based on that emotion; Happy, for example! This was a great oppertunity to learn a language I has no experience in and experiment with APIs.</p>

                    <p>I tried to stick to a consistent (quite blocky) look for all of the objects inside the house. It features user interaction with objects, collectible items and collision detecion.  I also used this game to learn how to create my own models, work with menus, particle effects and multiple scenes.</p>
